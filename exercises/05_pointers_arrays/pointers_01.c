/*
 * In C, variables store values, but sometimes we need to:
 *  - **Directly access memory**: Instead of just working with values, 
 *      pointers allow us to work with addresses.
 *      
 *  - **Efficiently modify data**: Passing large structures to 
 *      functions by pointer avoids making copies.
 *
 *  - **Work with dynamic memory**: Pointers are essential for 
 *      allocating memory at runtime (malloc/free).
 *
 *  - **Interact with hardware**: Low-level programming 
 *      (e.g., embedded systems, OS development) relies on pointers.
